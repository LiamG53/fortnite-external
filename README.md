bridges burn, they never will return. sorry for my dear friends that were using this for testing private features.

### reason
haven't posted much recently or anything at all, a friend of mine decided to do some childish things which forced me to leak this.
i was not ratted for this source but i just want to prove my point xD..

### info
you must have an intel CPU, and be on windows 23h2-22h2 (otherwise) it will not work. 
amd is not supported, this was a private project made at targeting (easy-anti-cheat) fortnite's anti-cheat software, also made by epic games.
everything is included within (fortnite-external/dependencies/memory/) this is where all memory utilities are, yes this will work with any easy-anti-cheat protected games.
rendering? you do not need to install anything for the overlay.

### dma 
no this project does not support dma.

### features
this source contains tons of test features, including first-person, free-camera, memory-aimbot (not posting on github, contact me private), no-fall-damage, instant-reload, no-spread, player-fly (not posting on github, contact me private).

### star
get this to 50 stars for full source.
